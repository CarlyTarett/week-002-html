Dynamic Parts of the web page

1.  The Task Count
2.  Each task name in each task row
3.  The number of rows will change so the tasks section itself will be dynamic 
    and increase and decrease in size.

Curent issues
    We don't know how long the page content will be at any given point

    What happens if a user types in a very long task name, will we limit? Wrap text? Cut?
    Otherwise the user might have to scroll a long way to the right to get the done and delete buttons
